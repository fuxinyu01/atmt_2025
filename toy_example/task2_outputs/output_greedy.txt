third question concerns the attributability of the negotiations.
The question is essentially to establish whether the Commission could legitimately attribute the liability for an infringement committed by another undertaking on the basis of a unilateral declaration issued by TKS.
I would also like to specify that the public authority, such as the Commission whose role is to monitor the application of the principles laid down in Article 81 EC, cannot derogate from the rules and principles relating to the imputability of negotiations under specific agreements concluded between undertakings.

main objective of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase by 2020 by the average length of healthy life in the EU by two years.
partnerships aim to improve the quality of life of older people and more effective solutions in healthcare.
to use innovation in a larger scale than that now, in areas such as health promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems, as well as assistant technologies.
the Commission will analyse the consultation analysis to gain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in various areas that have an impact on ageing at this time at this time.
further action in the European Innovation Partnership process is then planned on the basis of these responses.
on-line consultation is also held with a conference on the European Innovation Partnership in the field of active and healthy ageing today, held in Brussels today.
more than 150 representatives of stakeholders discuss their views on it as to transform partnerships to specific acts.
of the European Innovation Partnership in the field of active and healthy ageing is part of the EU strategy "Innovation" strategy, one of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives to transform ideas in jobs, environmental growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
of the Union innovation has a three objective: to allow Europe to achieve scientific results at world level, to change the way of cooperation between the public and private sectors, especially through innovation partnerships, and to remove obstacles (such as costly patents, market fragmentation, slow deployment of standards and insufficient qualifications) currently preventing rapid penetration of ideas on the market.
this corresponds to the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe, which is fully exploited by the potential of ICT and promote prosperity and improve the quality of life (see IP/10/581, MEMO/10/199 and MEMO/10/200).

initiatives aimed at regional cooperation in the field of nutrition should be strengthened. Asia should be strengthened, initiatives aimed at regional cooperation in the field of nutrition.
harmonisation of EU intervention Access to food security in developing countries must be based on the principle of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of the assistance, the Action Programme of the Akry and the EU Code as regards the workshops in the field of development policy.
EU and Member States should identify regions and countries in relation to which they should divide their work, and coordinate their activities under the direction of a particular major donor.
EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments available to partner countries to help tackle food security problems.
greater effectiveness of their measures should help to harmonise policies, closer links to tools and coordination with private investors.
coordination of policies for development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through a range of policy instruments including agriculture, trade, fisheries, combating climate change, environmental protection and research.
this cohesion has been strengthened through the reform of the common agricultural policy and future reforms will be taken into account to global food security objectives by taking account of food security.
future reform of the common fisheries policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods, of the one part, and the development objectives, of the other part, on the other hand.
in the last place would be achieved by achieving balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the development programme from Doha, strengthening the international trading system, which would have a positive impact on food security.
improve the coherence of the EU's international system and Member States should better align the way food security is managed internationally and promote accelerated reform of the Food Security Committee in the world (CFS), which is the central body in that area.
the revised Committee should seek the power of supervision in other specific areas affecting food security, such as food aid and nutrition areas.
furthermore, the priorities of the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and in the interests of synergies should be improved as well as their mutual cooperation.
reform of the UN and ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are opportunities to increase quality and efficiency.

not necessary to ask the question whether the parties themselves are raised; the national judge may also lay it without the proposal.
Reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation of each court concerned has jurisdiction to refer the question referred to the Court of Justice concerning the interpretation of Community law, where it considers it necessary to resolve the dispute submitted to it.
, contrary to the court whose decisions cannot be challenged by remedies under national law, it is essentially obliged to submit that question, unless there is a case-law (and any new framework does not raise real doubts as to the possibility of applying this case-law) or the correct method of interpretation of Community rules is quite obvious.
in particular where the case is sufficiently clarified on the basis of the case-law of the Court of Justice, the Court may decide itself to make the correct interpretation of Community law and its application to the facts made.
, however, a reference for a preliminary ruling may show, at a appropriate stage of the procedure, as particularly useful, in the light of the new interpretation of the general importance for the uniform application of Community law or where the existing case-law does not appear to be applicable to a fully new factual framework.
the national court is to explain what the interpretation required to bring its judgment into the judgment is necessary.
to reject the application for a preliminary ruling on the validity of the national courts, where the national courts have the possibility to refuse the pleas relating to invalidity which are applied before them, the possibility to declare Community acts as invalid falls within the exclusive competence of the Court.
to the Court of Justice, the reference for a preliminary ruling must be made to the Court if it has doubts as to the validity of the Community act, indicating the reasons for which the Community act could be affected by invalidity.
however, where a national court has serious doubts as to the validity of a Community measure on which a national act is based, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of that act or, in that regard, take any other precautionary measures.
then, it is required to ask the question relating to the validity of the Court and to state reasons why the Community act is not valid.
, when the reference for a preliminary ruling is made, the national court may submit a request for a preliminary ruling as soon as it finds that a decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to give judgment; it is a national court which is best able to assess in which such a request is to be made.
however, it is desirable that the decision to refer a preliminary ruling is taken at the stage of the proceedings where the judge is able to define the facts and legal framework of the problem, so that the Court has all the evidence necessary, where appropriate, to verify that Community law in the main proceedings is applicable.
should also be shown to be asked to refer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling after the contradictory discussion of the case.
a reference for a preliminary ruling from the decision which the national court asks the questions referred to the Court for a preliminary ruling may be adopted in any form which national law admits for procedural issues.
however, it should be held that this document, which is the basis for the proceedings which will take place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have the knowledge that will enable it to give it a useful answer to the national court.

following the first World War, Austria and Germany became republics, repealed nobility and all privileges and titles associated with it.
from that time, for Austrian nationals, illegal use of all the nobles; the prohibition includes the use of such homeless as the ‘von’ or ‘zu’ as part of the surname.
however, in Germany, another approach has been chosen: existing titles, although they cannot be used as such, they become part of the surname, go to all children and are subject only to changes related to the child's sex if such element has a male and female shape – such as F ?? rst (first) and F ? rstin (class).

if the 10-year limitation period should start running until the transfer of APSA vaccines to the Ministry of Health, it would have to be determined for the precise moment of the sale of APMSD vaccines to the Ministry of Health to set the date of the start of the limitation period.
notwithstanding the fact that, under that assumption, the limitation period for APSA was suspended in time by bringing an action against APMSD ( 36 ) would be suspended on 16 October 2002 against APSA in any event before the expiry of a 10-year period, if the vaccine was the sale of the Ministry of Health in circulation on 16 October 1992 . ( 37 ) .
Even if it could not be established for a precise time of the sale of the vaccine to the Ministry of Health, it would be possible only to define it between 22 September 1992 — the date of adoption of the vaccine in APMSD — and on 3 November 1992 — vaccination of the opponent — would be initiated against APSA on 16 October 2002 in any event the limitation period in time.
if APSA has argued that the limitation should also prove the moment of placing a vaccine into circulation. ( 38 ) if APPSa would have to demonstrate the moment of the placing on the vaccine.
if APSA could only define this moment as a certain period beginning more than 10 years before the application was brought, but it ends less than 10 years before it was given, APSA would not only be a burden of proof but also a demonstration risk of determining the precise moment of the limitation period.
, even if the precise moment of putting into circulation were not determined, the court would be initiated on 16 October 2002 in any event, and therefore the effects of the interruption of the limitation period would be the effect of the suspension of the limitation period.

in the case of both proceedings, the period examined actually overlapped in time.
however, it was only overlapping the first three months of the investigated period from the current procedure.
in accordance with Article 6(1) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure representative results, should normally cover the period examined for six months immediately preceding the initiation of the procedure for the first time.
in those circumstances, it was decided that the data from the first three months of the investigation period would not be sufficiently representative for the seasonal functioning and the constant nitrate market.
furthermore, it should be stressed that the use of information obtained under a specific procedure for a specific purpose in a different procedure and for other purposes, where the party concerned did not show the willingness to cooperate in the second investigation would be contrary to the provisions of Article 19(6) of the basic Regulation.

framework for dialogue The framework for relations with Eastern Europe countries and the Southern Caucasus is a European Neighbourhood Policy.
, although on cooperation in migration, visa issues, asylum policy, border management and other related economic and social issues are indirectly mentioned in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which forms the legal basis of the EC relationship with these countries, these topics are also included in all European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan, which were negotiated with Eastern Partners.
also have their own national action programmes in this context, some of these partner countries have also have their own national action programmes in this context.
in Ukraine there is a specific action plan for justice, freedom and security, which corresponds to the part of this area in the action plans negotiated with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova, and the Commission also cooperates with Ukraine on the basis of evaluation results from the Action Plan on Justice, Freedom and Security, which is the direct point.
on migration issues are discussed in detail with Moldova and Ukraine in the relevant subcommittees and are also discussed at regular meetings of the EU-Ukraine Ministerial Trika, Justice, Security and Justice meetings, as well as the Cooperation Cooperation Committee meetings.
similar approach is followed by three countries of Southern Caucasus whose action plans were adopted in November 2006.
dialogue and cooperation with individual countries is progressing through different pace, according to their ability, size (which applies especially in the case of Ukraine) and the situation.
, even though Belarus is a special case[7], technical cooperation on border policy issues, migration and organised crime is possible on the basis of contacts with the Belarus representatives at work level and within regional dialogue and regional programmes.

against doping Dopping remains a serious threat to sport. The fight against doping remains a fight against the Doping docking remains a serious threat to sport.
use of doping substances in the event of non-professional athletes constitutes a serious threat to public health and requires preventive measures, including setting up centres for the stucco of good physical condition.
prevention and disabilities in the area of doping fall within the competence of sports organisations and Member States.
The Commission supports the fight against doping and the important role of the World Anti-Doping Agency, National Anti-Doping Organisations, accredited laboratories, the Council of Europe and UNESCO organisations.
The Commission also welcomes the fact that national anti-doping organisations are increasingly organised as independent authorities more frequently.
Member States shall take up and share national anti-doping action plans aimed at ensuring coordination between all relevant sectors.

The Commission stresses the need for anti-doping rules and procedures consistent with EU legislation in respect of fundamental rights and principles such as privacy and family life, protection of personal data and right to a fair trial and presumption of innocence.
any restriction on the exercise of such rights and freedoms must be given by law and respect the nature of those rights and the principle of proportionality.

with caution in patients with potential risk of increased trauma bleeding, surgery or due to other pathological conditions and, if co- administration of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-phlific (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective serotonin inhibitors (SRI).
patients should be carefully monitored to see whether any signs of bleeding, including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiological performance or surgery.
concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
If the patient is to undergo the planned operation and the anti-aggregation effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be set up for 7 days prior to performance.
patients should inform physicians and dental physicians from planning any operation or other pharmacotherapy that they are taking clopidogrel prior to planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy.
copidogrel extends bleeding time and should therefore be administered to patients with tendency to bleed (especially gastrointestinal and intraocular) cautionly.
4 Patients should be informed that if they take clopidogrel (alone or in combination with ASA), the bleeding ban could take longer than usual and that they should inform their doctor of each unusual bleeding (designation or duration).
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTTP) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was reported very rarely after taking clopidogrel, sometimes after short exposure.
the thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated either with neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever.
TTP is potentially fatal condition requiring unreasonable treatment including plasmafereses.
received haemophilia Following clopidogrel use, haemophilia was reported.
where the only occurrence of prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APT) with bleeding or without bleeding is confirmed, the possibility of hemophilia obtained is needed.
patients with confirmed haemophilia receive confirmed patients should be treated with specialized doctor and clopidogrel administration should be completed.
recent stroke event Given the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days following acute ischemical stroke event.

to submit to the Commission, for this purpose, the Commission intends to submit a noise committee referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme, which contains some of the elements below.
if necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will give a complaint to the judicial procedure to supplement the active implementation of the activities described below.
completion of the harmonised framework for mapping methods In spite of improving comparability of strategic noise mapping is not a situation far from ideal.
ongoing evaluation is apparent that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of people exposed to excessive noise levels is still difficult to submit comparable data.
, among other things, the difficulties are linked to different data collection methods, qualities and availability of data and the methods of evaluation used.
of the different results in EU Member States are causing different results.
in the end, the comparable level required will ultimately lead the harmonisation framework for methods(s) which will reflect sufficiently sectoral specifications.
in 2008 the Commission started working on the development of harmonised methods of noise exposure (according to Article 6(2)).
: the project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common noise assessment methods in Europe) which leads the Joint Research Centre, shall ensure a technical basis for the preparation of the Commission Implementing Decision.
, provided that technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers the possible revision of Annex II to the Rural Area Directive at the beginning of 2012 (the Committee will issue an opinion in 2011).
harmonised methodological framework could focus on strategic mapping and should carefully balance the needs in the field of harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specifications, such as data requirements.
under this Decision The Commission intends to propose a joint work programme from the Commission/European Environment/Member States aimed at implementing the CNOSSOS-EU project for 2012-2015 to be operational for the third reporting cycle in 2017.
development of EU guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaving space for different interpretations and implementation of different interpretations and implementation.
Member States have proposed that these issues be addressed through a specific action that will help implement and compliance at EU level, such as the development of documents with guidelines, exchange information on best practices or by organising special workshops and training courses.
such action could focus on the following issues: the mapping and best practice of mapping, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and reaction, calculation of repeated exposure, action plans and permissible or target values.
the Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs and costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen in the context of this procedure.

Article 28 of the Charter ensures the right to collective bargaining.
This right shall be exercised ‘in accordance with Union law’ (Union law) in accordance with Union law’.
where the EU law precludes provisions in a collective agreement, the national court must not apply that specific provision to the extent necessary to remedy the illegality of illegality.
, in so far as the Court has held that the EU law precludes the application of the principle of ‘mean’ to a dependent child, it must not be a specific provision determining the proportional reduction in that contribution to the staff for part-time work (in the present case Article 22(4) of the collective agreement in the banking sector) to apply.
therefore, the dependent child contribution paid to the full extent provided for in Article 22(1) of that contract would be paid to the dependent child.

creating a legal and fiscal environment which is favourable to businesses To enable our businesses to use all the opportunities offered by the Single Market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the Single Market is based, simple, adapted and have to meet problems facing businesses in everyday activities.
measures proposed in this section are, inter alia, composed with a reduction in administrative and regulatory burden, with positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
in this context, very concrete initiatives will be adopted to ensure the interconnection of trade companies and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union will be adopted to ensure that the registers of companies and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
further, fiscal issues are also essential. The issues of fiscal are also essential.
taxation initiatives or VAT should reduce administrative burden on businesses and facilitate their cross-border activities and their cross-border activities.
furthermore, special attention is deserved to the defence and security sector, as they stimulate development and growth throughout the economy due to their top technology, innovation and know-how.
proposal 19 : The Commission will adopt initiatives to improve coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular the proposal for a directive to create a common consolidated basis for taxation of companies (CZZS) in 2011.
between 27 existing national taxation systems in the EU there are large differences, creating significant fiscal barriers to cross-border activities of companies, or even preclude that activity prevents the company from the EU.
such fragmentation leads to significant market disturbances and the cost of placing in accordance with the provisions of the regulation.
particularly SMEs, often find the necessary means to overcome these deficiencies, and can dissuade them from developing on the single market.
establishing a common consolidated basis for taxation of companies to address the problem of fiscal provisions that limit growth.
companies should only be governed by a single set of rules in fiscal matters and only act only with one fiscal management across the EU (single contact point) should be treated with a single set of rules.
should be consolidated at the group level and losses should be deducted from profits regardless of the border.
cases of double taxation or double exemption from tax due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal legislation would be excluded in relations within groups.
not coordinated national measures would merely reproduce the current situation, since companies would still be confronted with so many fiscal systems, as many States in which they operate.
in this context, it should be recalled that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that, if a resolution authority adopts a report on non-compliant measures, the Council may, if it considers appropriate, repeal or amend the contested measure or take other appropriate measures to take account of legal interpretations in it formulated.
in accordance with recital 5 of that Regulation, the EU institutions may consider appropriate to withdraw or amend measures taken under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution procedure under the memorandum to the rules and procedures governing disputes, or take other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the resolution authority.
, secondly, as the applicant correctly states, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the objective of those provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, as is the case in the case of basic Regulation which was adopted to comply with international obligations arising from the anti-dumping Agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

such products should be included within the scope of the measures given, as they have the same physical and chemical characteristics and end-use as a product covered by the existing measures.
product concerned and new product types should therefore be considered as the only product.

42 By failing to establish Article 2 of the decision on the comitology which provides for non-binding criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be respected, according to the appellant, it has not been correct to rule on the regulatory procedure only for measures with general scope.
– Commission’s arguments 43 The Commission considers that the reference to recital 9 in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of that regulation imposing a specific duty if two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP.
44 As regards Article 2 of the decision on comitology, the Commission contests the CMF’s assertion that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measures with general scope.
Findings of the Court 45 The two parts of the appeal examined, and therefore, that plea in law, is not self-existence, and therefore, that ground of appeal itself, do not have a separate existence.
47, As the Advocate General points out in point 41 of his Opinion, both parts of the appeal examined are more specifically raised in the fourth, respectful third ground of appeal, which is challenged by the Court’s own legal analysis.
48, The appeal is therefore consistent with the fourth, fourth, third ground of appeal, the appeal is to be applied to the ground of appeal.
4 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them independently.
, on the ground of appeal alleging distortion of the facts of the context Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF contends that, at paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance adopted the facts of the case, adopted a completely fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities regarding the existence of indirect invoicing.
51 This performance is incomplete and incorrect, thus leads to distortion of facts.

in that regard, it is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
, however, it must be held that the Court stated, first, that the overall impression which triggered the mark applied for, dominates the element ‘creationale kennya’ to which the consumer concerned focuses broadly its attention, and, second, in particular, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the element ‘creationales kennya’ element is only in an interior position, which basically implies that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
in the light of the correct analysis, the Court of First Instance excluded any similarity between marks and 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, and in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, that, despite the reputation of earlier marks, the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks does not have any likelihood of confusion between those marks.
59 Consequently, the third part of the first ground of appeal must be declared unfounded.
, under those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected. 60 In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
, second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, when he did not examine the reputation of the earlier marks in the context of that provision.
in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance has held that the appellant claims a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was also specifically based on an infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation.
63 The Court of First Instance committed an error of law when it stated that, since the marks at issue are not similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
that the earlier mark of Calvin Klein was generally known, according to the appellant, should be taken into account for determining whether it is necessary to grant extensive protection.
good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing the similarity between marks at the conflicting marks and not after the similarity has been demonstrated.
64 In that regard, the appellant submits that if the famous mark of the cK was protected only if the third party would use the same graphical formation, it would mean that the trade mark with a good name would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection that would not be generally known.
that the trade mark and other distinct graphic formation of those letters are famous to them, confers protection against the use of the letter ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since Calvin Klein’s letters identified by Calvin Klein, so that their use by a third party is confronted by a confusion through the association.
OHIM contends that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rightly held on the question of good name of the earlier mark.
in so far as the contested designation cannot be considered similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 does not apply.
66 Zafra Marroquineros states that a reference is made to the reputation of the earlier marks in the judgment under appeal.

Mr O. O. Condition of the two children, and her two children, Mr. O. lives together with Mrs S. and her two children.
21 It is apparent from the order for reference that on 1 January 2010, Mr O. concluded a contract for a period of one year in which the daily eight-hour working hours and hours remuneration of EUR 7,50 was agreed.
however, it has not submitted any evidence that he would have proved that he actually worked on that contract.
22 By decision of 21 January 2009, Maahanmuttovirasto rejected Mr O’s request for a residence permit submitted to him, in the preamble to the statement that Mr O. had insufficient income.
in the present case, it considered that there was no reason for derogating from the conditions relating to the living resources, as enables Article 39(1) of the Foreign Law in cases of particularly serious circumstances or if the best interests of the child are required.
By judgment of 27 August 2009, Helsingin hallinto-oikeus (legal court in Helsinki) dismissed the action for annulment brought by Mr O. against that rejecting decision.
, Ms S. and Mr O. brought an appeal against that judgment to the Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court).

implementing rules should be laid down for this system to be laid down.
checks on conditionality may be completed before receiving payments and annual premiums under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
, in particular, where such checks cannot be completed before receiving such payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative penalties should be enforced in accordance with this Regulation or by commissioning.
rules on authorities in the Member States responsible for the control system of cross-compliance obligations should be laid down.
minimum level of checks should be established for verification of the conditionality obligations.
at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 should be determined at least at a level of 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and who must be selected on the basis of the corresponding risk analysis.
to calculate the control sample calculation, in the specific case of groups of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, flexibility should be granted to Member States in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or each member of the group individually.
Member States should be able to choose whether they meet the minimum level of control at the level of each competent control body, at the level of the paying agency or at the level of the act or standard or the set of acts or standards.
where the specific legislation applicable to the act or standards sets minimum control rates, Member States should respect these rates.
however, the Member States should be allowed to apply a uniform level of control for on-the-spot checks on conditionality checks.
if Member States choose this option, all cases of non-compliance identified during on-the-spot checks should be reported and subsequently monitored under conditionality should be monitored.
to simplify obligations in relation to the requirements of Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the use of specific sampling levels of monitoring plans should be considered to satisfy the minimum level of minimum level laid down in this Regulation.
flexibility necessary for the achievement of a minimum control rate by using results from other on-the-spot checks or replacement of beneficiaries should be granted to Member States.
to avoid the weakening of the control system, in particular as regards the selection of samples for on-the-spot checks, the minimum control sample should not be taken into account in the calculation of the calculation of the minimum control sample relating to conditionality in respect of the de minimis rule under Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
identification of significant degree of non-compliance in relation to conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks to reach an acceptable level of security in relation to the correctness of the aid applications concerned during the following year.

analysis of the basic factors and the fact that the reference value is complied with a wide range, confirm the positive outcome on price stability criteria.
in addition to Lithuania, this criterion is still met by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Sweden.
public finances – public debt and deficit amount currently not covered by Council Decision on the existence of excessive deficit (as referred to in Article 126(6) of the Treaty) of Article 126).
the deficit ratio of public finances to GDP fell from 5,5 % in 2011 to 2.1 % in 2013 and the Commission’s economic forecasts from spring 2014 are to remain at 2.1% in 2014 in 2014 at 2.1% in 2014.
overall public debt at the end of 2013 was 39.4% of GDP – that is significantly less than it sets out Maastricht Limits.
this criterion also meet Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Sweden.
the Czech Republic will also meet this criterion if the Council decides to repeal the excessive deficit procedure as proposed by the Commission.
to two Member States (Croatia and Poland) currently apply to excessive deficit procedure and therefore this criterion does not satisfy this criterion.
