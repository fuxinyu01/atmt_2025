third question concerns the attributability of the negotiations.
The question is essentially to establish whether the Commission could legitimately attribute the liability for an infringement committed by another undertaking on the basis of a unilateral declaration issued by TKS.
moreover, I want to specify that the public authority, such as the Commission whose role is to monitor the application of the principles laid down in Article 81 EC, cannot derogate from the rules and principles relating to the imputability of negotiations based on specific agreements concluded between undertakings.

main objective of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase by 2020 by the average length of healthy life in the EU by two years.
partnership seeks to improve the quality of life of older people and more effective solutions in healthcare.
to use innovation in a larger scale than that now, in areas such as health promotion, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems, as well as assistant technologies.
the Commission will analyse the consultation analysis to gain a clear view of the potential and capacity of innovation in different areas that have an impact on ageing at this time at this time.
on the basis of these responses, it then plans further action in the European Innovation Partnership for Innovation.
online consultation takes place at the same time with a conference on the European Innovation Partnership in the field of active and healthy ageing today held in Brussels today.
more than 150 representatives of stakeholders discussing their views on how to transform partnerships to specific acts.
of the European Innovation Partnership in the field of active and healthy ageing is part of the EU strategy “Innovation” strategy, one of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives to transform ideas in jobs, environmental growth and social progress (IP/10/1288).
in innovation has a three objective: to allow Europe to achieve scientific outcomes at world level, to change the way of cooperation between public and private sectors, especially through innovation partnerships, and to remove obstacles (such as costly patents, market fragmentation, slow deployment of standards and insufficient qualifications) currently preventing rapid penetration of ideas on the market.
this corresponds to the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe, fully exploiting the potential of ICT and promoting prosperity and improving the quality of life (see IP/10/581, MEMO/10/199 and MEMO/10/200).

initiatives aimed at regional cooperation in the field of nutrition should be strengthened in Asia.
harmonisation of EU intervention The EU approach to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of the assistance, the Action Programme of Akry and the EU Code as regards the workshops in the field of development policy.
EU and Member States should identify regions and countries in relation to which they should divide their work, and coordinate their activities under the direction of a particular major donor.
EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments available to partner countries to tackle food security problems.
greater effectiveness of their measures should help better harmonise policies, closer links to tools and coordination with private investors.
sustainability of policies for development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through a range of policy instruments including agriculture, trade, fisheries, combating climate change, environmental protection and research.
this cohesion has been strengthened through the reform of the common agricultural policy and future reforms will take account of food security objectives for global food security objectives.
the future reform of the common fisheries policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods, on the one hand, and the development objectives, of the other part.
in the last place, achieving balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the development programme from Doha would strengthen the international trading system, which would have a positive impact on food security.
improve the coherence of the international system of EU governance and Member States should better align the way food security is managed internationally and promote accelerated reform of the Food Security Committee in the world (CFS), which is the central body in that area.
the revised Committee should pursue the power of supervision in other specific areas affecting food security, such as food aid and nutrition.
furthermore, the priorities of the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) and in the interests of synergies should be improved as well as their mutual cooperation.
reform of the UN and ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are opportunities to increase quality and efficiency.

The question is not necessary to be raised by the parties themselves; the national judge may also ask it without a proposal.
Reference for a preliminary ruling concerning interpretation Each court concerned has jurisdiction to ask the Court a question concerning the interpretation of Community law where it considers it necessary to resolve the dispute submitted to it.
, contrary to the court whose decisions cannot be challenged by remedies under national law, it is essentially obliged to submit that question to the Court unless there is a case-law (and any new framework does not raise real doubts as to the possibility of application of that case-law) or the correct method of interpretation of Community rules.
in particular where the case is sufficiently clarified on the basis of the case-law of the Court of Justice’s case-law, the Court may decide itself on the correct interpretation of Community law and its application to the facts made.
, however, a reference for a preliminary ruling may show, at the appropriate stage of the procedure, in particular, a new question of interpretation which is of general importance for the uniform application of Community law or where the existing case-law does not appear applicable to a fully new factual framework.
the national court is to explain what the required interpretation is necessary for the ruling of its judgment.
request for a preliminary ruling on the validity assessment Where national courts have the possibility to refuse the pleas relating to invalidity which are applied before them, the possibility to declare the Community act invalid falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court.
so, each national court must ask the Court for a preliminary ruling if it has doubts as to the validity of the Community measure, indicating the reasons for which it considers that Community action could be affected by invalidity.
however, where a national court has serious doubts as to the validity of a Community measure on which a national act is based, it may exceptionally suspend temporarily the implementation of that act or, in that regard, take any other precautionary measures.
then, it is required to ask the question relating to the validity of the Court and to state reasons why the Community act is not valid.
to submit a reference for a preliminary ruling from the national court, the Court may submit a reference for a preliminary ruling as soon as it finds that a decision on the question or questions of interpretation or validity is necessary to give its judgment; it is a national court which can best assess in what stage the proceedings must be made.
however, it is desirable for a preliminary ruling to be taken at the stage of the procedure where the judge is able to define the facts and legal framework of the problem, so that the Court has all the evidence necessary, where appropriate, to verify that Community law in the main proceedings is applicable.
should also be shown in the interests of the proper exercise of justice to ask the question referred for a preliminary ruling after the contradictory discussion of the case.
to the form of a reference for a preliminary ruling from the decision which the national court asks the question referred to the Court may be adopted in any form admitted by national law in the case of procedural issues.
however, it must be held that this document, which is the basis for the proceedings which will take place before the Court of Justice and that the Court must have the knowledge to enable it to give it a useful answer to the national court.

attainment of the objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP) should not be jeopardised by Member States which violate its rules.
according to Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) financial assistance from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (ENDF) is conditional upon compliance with the rules of the CFP by Member States.
failure to comply with the rules of the CFP Member States may result in interruptions or suspension of payments or execution of financial repair of Union financial assistance granted under the CFP.
in Article 83(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 3 ) , the conditions under which the suspension of payment may be imposed and Article 142(1) of that regulation suspends payment.
two articles provide that, in connection with the failure to comply with the rules under the CFP, specific rules may lay down specific grounds for interruption and suspension of payments.
, in order to protect the financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers, where a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the CFP, or where the Commission has evidence indicating such failure, the Commission shall be able to stay the payment period under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.
In addition to the discontinuation of the payment deadline and to prevent the risk of paying ineligible expenditure, the Commission may suspend payments in the event of serious failure to comply with the CFP rules in accordance with Article 101 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.
financial implications of penalties imposed on Member States if they do not comply with the rules of the CFP should be proportionate to the nature, gravity, duration and repeat non-compliance with rules.
in order to ensure legal certainty for Member States carrying out operational programmes within the ENRF, cases of failure to comply with the CFP rules essential to maintain marine biological resources which may, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, lead to a suspension of payment deadline or suspension of payments.
without prejudice to all other penalties imposed on CFP rules, these cases will be used for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 and the implementation of Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
failure to comply with the rules of the CFP, which are essential for maintaining biological marine resources, should be considered serious if the Member State has not taken the necessary measures to remedy the situation resulting in the suspension of the payment period.
prior to the suspension or suspension of payments, the Commission must adopt implementing acts under Article 100(2) and Article 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, which further specifies the failure to fulfil obligations under the CFP by a Member State which may affect expenditure required for which a continuous payment is required.
since it is important to ensure uniform and equal treatment with operators in all Member States from the start of the programming period, this Regulation should enter into force on the first day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union , HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
failure to comply with the rules In the Annex to this Regulation, cases of failure to fulfil obligations of a Member State within the CFP which may lead to a suspension of payment deadline relating to an interim payment application pursuant to Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014.

in Doln Tory has never worked yet, but it seems to have been a rapidly emerging middle class neighborhood of traders so established that they were aristocratic in addition to the blood and genus.
until they were obediently rich, they had an iron in every political fire, and as a class had ethical obstacles of feeding shark.
Since they had already reached the top in their field, their efforts were the only direction they had remained before them, and their eyes turned to Aristocracy.

if the 10-year limitation period should start running until the transfer of APSA vaccines to the Ministry of Health, it would have to be determined precise moments of the sale of APMSD vaccines to the Ministry of Health to set the date of the start of the limitation period.
notwithstanding whether, under that assumption, the limitation period for APSA was suspended in time by bringing an action against APMSD ( 36 ) would, on 16 October 2002, be initiated before the expiry of the 10-year period, if the vaccine would be included in the circulation on 16 October 1992, ( 37 ) .
, even if it could no longer be possible to discover precise moments of the sale of a vaccine to the Ministry of Health, and it would be possible only to define it between 22 September 1992 — the date of adoption of a vaccine in APMSD — and on 3 November 1992 — vaccination of the opponent — would be initiated against APSA on 16 October 2002 in any event the limitation period in time.
if APSA complained of a limitation, it would also have to demonstrate a moment of placing a vaccine into circulation. ( 38 ) if APPSA would have to demonstrate the moment of placing the vaccine into circulation.
if APSA as a producer could only define this moment as a certain period starting more than 10 years before bringing an action but ends less than 10 years before submitting it, APSA would not only be a burden of proof but also a demonstration risk of determining the precise moment of the limitation period.
, even where the precise moment of putting into circulation is not determined, the court would be initiated on 16 October 2002 in any event, and therefore the effects of interrupting the limitation period should be interrupted.

in the case of both proceedings, the period examined actually overlapped in time.
however, only the first three months of the investigated period from the current procedure was overlaid.
in accordance with Article 6(1) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure representative results, should normally cover the investigated period for a period of six months immediately preceding the initiation of the procedure.
in those circumstances, it was decided that data from the first three months of the investigation period would not be sufficiently representative for the seasonally functioning and the constant nitrate market.
furthermore, it should be emphasised that the use of information obtained under a particular procedure for a specific purpose in a different procedure and for other purposes where the party concerned did not show the willingness to cooperate in the second investigation would be contrary to the provisions of Article 19(6) of the basic Regulation.

with caution should be used in patients with a potential risk of increased trauma bleeding, surgery or due to other pathological conditions and, in the event of concomitant administration of clopidogrel and ASA, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or nonsteroidal antiflogic (NSAID) including cox-2 inhibitors or selective serotonin inhibitors (SRI).
patients should be carefully monitored whether any signs of bleeding, including occult bleeding, especially during the first weeks of treatment and/or after invasive cardiological performance or surgery should be reported.
concomitant administration of clopidogrel with oral anticoagulants is not recommended since it may increase bleeding intensity (see section 4.5).
If the patient is to undergo the planned operation and the anti-aggregation effect is not temporarily desirable, clopidogrel should be discontinued for 7 days prior to performance.
patients should prior to planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy tell physicians and dental physicians that they take clopidogrel prior to planning any surgery or other pharmacotherapy.
copidogrel extends bleeding time and should therefore be administered to patients with tendency to bleed (especially gastrointestinal and intraocular) carefully.
4 Patients should be informed that if they take clopidogrel (alone or in combination with ASA), the arrest of bleeding could take longer than usual and that they should inform each unusual bleeding (locity of occurrence or duration) of their doctor.
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTTP) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was reported very rarely after taking clopidogrel, sometimes after short exposure.
of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia associated either with neurological findings, renal dysfunction or fever.
TTP is potentially a fatal condition requiring urgent treatment including plasmafereses.
received haemophilia Following the use of clopidogrel, haemophilia has been reported.
in cases where a single occurrence of prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APT) with bleeding or without bleeding is confirmed, it is necessary to take account of the possibility obtained by haemophilia.
patients with confirmed haemophilia should be treated with a specialised doctor and the administration of clopidogrel should be completed.
recent stroke event Given the lack of data, clopidogrel cannot be recommended during the first 7 days following acute ischemical stroke event.

in this respect, the Commission intends to submit the noise committee referred to in Article 13 of the Work Programme Directive, which contains some of the elements below.
if necessary, the Commission will also consider whether it will stimulate the judicial procedure to supplement the active implementation of the activities described below.
completion of a harmonised framework for mapping methods In spite of improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping is far from the ideal situation.
ongoing evaluation is apparent that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of people exposed to excessive noise levels.
, among other things, the difficulties relate to different data collection methods, qualities and availability of data and the evaluation methods used.
of the different results in EU Member States are causing different results.
the required comparability level will ultimately lead the harmonisation framework for methods(s) which will sufficiently reflect the sectoral specifications.
in 2008 the Commission started working on the development of harmonised noise exposure methods (as referred to in Article 6(2)).
project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common noise assessment methods in Europe), which leads the Joint Research Centre, shall ensure a technical basis for the preparation of the Commission Implementing Decision.
, provided that technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers the possible revision of Annex II to the Rural Area Directive at the beginning of 2012 (the Committee will issue an opinion in 2011).
harmonised methodological framework could concentrate on strategic mapping and should carefully balance the needs in the field of harmonisation of adequacy and sectoral specifications such as data requirements.
within this Decision, the Commission intends to propose a joint work programme from the Commission/European Environment/Member States aimed at implementing the CNOSSOS-EU project for 2012-2015 to functional for the third reporting cycle in 2017.
development of EU guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive has not been detailed or leaving space for different interpretations and implementation.
number of Member States have proposed that these issues be addressed through specific actions to help implement and comply at EU level, such as the development of documents with guidelines, exchange information on best practices or by organising special workshops and training courses.
such an action could focus on the following issues: mapping and best practices of mapping, forecast values for noise maps, relationships between dose and reaction, calculation of repeated exposure, action plans and permissible or target values.
the Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs as well as the costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen under this procedure.

the creation of a legal and fiscal environment, which is favourable to undertakings In order to enable our businesses to use all the opportunities offered by the Single Market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the Single Market is based, simple, adapted and have to meet problems faced by businesses in daily activities.
measures proposed in this section include, inter alia, reducing administrative and regulatory burden, with positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
very specific initiatives will be adopted in this context to ensure the interconnection of trade companies registers and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
furthermore, fiscal issues are also essential.
taxation of companies or VAT should reduce the administrative burden of undertakings and facilitate their cross-border activities.
furthermore, it deserves particular attention to the defence and security sector because they stimulate development and growth throughout the economy due to their top technology, innovation and know-how.
proposal 19 : The Commission will adopt initiatives to improve coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular the proposal for a directive to create a common consolidated basis for taxation of companies (CZZS) in 2011.
between 27 existing national taxation systems in the EU there are large differences, creating significant fiscal barriers to cross-border activities of companies, or even hinder this activity.
such fragmentation leads to significant market disturbances and the cost of placing in accordance with the provisions.
particularly SMEs that often find the necessary means to overcome these deficiencies, and can dissuade them from developing on the single market.
establishing a common consolidated basis for taxation of companies should address the problem of fiscal provisions that limit growth.
groups of companies should follow only a single set of rules in fiscal matters and only act only with one fiscal management across the EU (‘single contact point’).
should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted from profits regardless of the border.
cases of double taxation or double exemption from tax due to differences or incompatibility between national fiscal rules would be excluded in relations within groups.
not coordinated measures at national level would merely reproduce the current situation, since companies would still be confronted with so many fiscal systems such as those companies operating.
in this context, it should be recalled that Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1515/2001 provides that, if the resolution authority adopts a report on non-compliant measures, the Council may, if it considers appropriate, repeal or amend the contested measure or take other appropriate measures to take account of legal interpretations in it formulated.
in accordance with recital 5 of that Regulation, the EU institutions may consider appropriate to abolish or amend the measures adopted under the basic Regulation, including those not subject to dispute resolution procedure within the framework of the memorandum to the rules and procedures governing disputes, or take other specific measures taking into account the legal interpretation contained in the report adopted by the resolution authority.
, secondly, as the applicant correctly states, the provisions of EU law must be interpreted as far as possible in the light of international law, in particular where the objective of those provisions is to implement an international agreement concluded by the Community, as is the case in the case of a basic regulation adopted to comply with international obligations arising from the anti-dumping Agreement (see recital 3 of the basic Regulation).

The applicant stated that the new product types appeared on the market, such as cross-cutted plates consisting only of wood leaves, each of which has a thickness of not more than 6 mm, at least one outer layer of wood binangor, red carium, kedondong or some other species.
such products should be included within the scope of the measures given, as they have the same physical and chemical characteristics and end-use as a product covered by existing measures.
product concerned and new product types should therefore be considered as a single product.

42 By failing to establish Article 2 of the decision on the comitology which provides for non-binding criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be respected, according to the appellant’s appellants in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, the regulatory procedure could only be applied to measures with general scope.
– The Commission’s arguments 43 The Commission considers that the reference to recital ninth recital in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/94 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of the second subparagraph of Article 3 of that regulation imposing a specific duty if two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP.
44 As regards Article 2 of the Comitology Decision, the Commission contests the CMF’s assertion that the Court of First Instance stated that the regulatory procedure can only be applied to measures with general scope.
Findings of the Court 45 The two parts of the appeals examined and, therefore, that ground of appeal itself, do not have autonomous existence.
47 As the Advocate General points out in paragraph 41 of his Opinion, both parts of the appeal examined are more specifically raised within the fourth, third ground of appeal, which is challenged by the Court’s own legal analysis.
48 That part of the ground of appeal is therefore consistent with the fourth, third ground of appeal.
4 49 Consequently, it is not necessary to examine them independently.
, on the ground of appeal alleging distortion of the factual framework Arguments of the parties – Arguments of the appellants 50 CMF submits that, at paragraphs 14 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance adopted the facts of the case, adopted a completely fictional legal structure of the competent national authorities regarding the existence of indirect invoicing.
51 This performance is incomplete and incorrect, thus leads to distortion of the facts.

in that regard, it is sufficient that the common component is not negligible.
, however, it must be held that the Court stated, first, that the overall impression raised by the mark applied for is dominated by the element ‘creationale kennya’ to which the consumer concerned focuses broadly its attention, and, second, in particular, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the element ‘creationales kennya’ element is merely an interior position, which is essentially the conclusion that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
in the light of the correct analysis, the Court of First Instance excluded any similarity between the marks at issue and in paragraphs 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, rightly concluded that despite the reputation of earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the conflicting marks, there is no likelihood of confusion between those marks.
59 Consequently, the third part of the first ground of appeal must be declared unfounded.
first ground of appeal must be rejected under those conditions. 60 In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
second ground of appeal Arguments of the parties 61 By its second ground of appeal, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94, when he did not examine the reputation of the earlier marks within that provision.
in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance found that the appellant claims a single plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was also specifically based on an infringement of Article 8(5) of that regulation.
63 The Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that, since the marks at issue are not similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of earlier marks.
that the earlier mark of Calvin Klein was generally known, according to the appellant should be taken into account in order to determine whether it should be granted more extensive protection.
good name of the earlier mark must be assessed in assessing the similarity between the marks at issue and not after the similarity has been demonstrated.
64 In that regard, the appellant submits that if the famous trade mark has been protected only if the third party’s letter ‘cK’ used the same way as the graphic formation, it would mean that the trade mark with a good name would be granted the level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection that would not be generally known.
that the trade mark, as well as other different graphic formation of those letters, are famous, confers protection against the use of the letter ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since Calvin Klein’s letter identifies them, so that their use by a third party is confusing a confusion through associations.
OHIM contends that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rightly held on the question of good name of the earlier mark.
since the contested designation cannot be regarded as similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 does not apply.
66 Zafra Marroquineros states that a reference is made to the reputation of the earlier marks in the judgment under appeal.

Mr O. O. lives together with Ms S. and her two children.
21 It follows from the order for reference that on 1 January 2010, Mr O. concluded a contract for a period of one year in which a daily eight-hour working hours and an hour remuneration of EUR 7,50 was agreed.
however, he did not translate any document which would have proved that he actually worked under this contract.
22 By decision of 21 January 2009, Maahanmuttovirasto rejected Mr O’s request for a residence permit submitted to him, with the statement that Mr O. had no sufficient income.
furthermore, in the present case, it considered that there was no reason to derogate from the conditions relating to the living resources, as enables Article 39(1) of the Foreign Law, in particular serious circumstances, or if the best interests of the child.
By judgment of 27 August 2009, Helsingin hallinto-oikeus dismissed the action for annulment brought by Mr O. against that rejection of the decision.
therefore, Ms S. and Mr O. brought an appeal against that judgment to Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court).

implementing rules for this system should be laid down.
checks on conditionality may be completed prior to receipt of payments and annual premiums under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
, in particular, where such checks cannot be completed prior to receipt of such payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative penalties should be enforced in accordance with this Regulation or starting.
rules concerning authorities in the Member States responsible for the control system of cross-compliance obligations should be laid down.
minimum rate of checks should be fixed for verification of cross-compliance obligations.
at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and who must be selected on the basis of an appropriate risk analysis.
for the purpose of calculating the control sample, in the specific case of groups of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, flexibility should be granted to Member States in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or each member of the group individually.
Member States should be able to choose whether they meet the minimum level of control at the level of each competent control body, at the level of the paying agency or at the level of the act or standards, or a set of acts or standards.
where specific legislation applicable to acts or standards sets minimum control rates, Member States should observe these rates by the Member States.
however, the Member States should be allowed to apply a uniform level of control on-the-spot checks on conditionality.
if Member States choose this option, all cases of non-compliance identified during on-the-spot checks under sectoral legislation should be reported and subsequently monitored under conditionality.
with a view to simplifying obligations in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the use of specific sampling levels of monitoring plans should be considered to satisfy the minimum level requirement set out in this Regulation.
flexibility necessary in order to achieve a minimum control rate by using results from other on-the-spot checks or replace recipients should be granted to Member States.
to avoid the weakening of the control system, in particular as regards the selection of samples for on-the-spot checks, should not take account of the subsequent checks carried out in relation to the de minimis rule under Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
identification of significant degree of non-compliance in relation to conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks in order to achieve an acceptable level of security as regards the accuracy of the aid applications in question.

public finances – public debt and deficit amount Currently not subject to Council Decision on the existence of excessive deficit (as referred to in Article 126(6) of the Treaty).
GDP deficit ratio decreased from 5.5% in 2011 to 2.1% in 2013 and, according to the Commission’s economic forecast, the Commission’s 2014 spring forecast is to remain at 2.1% in 2014.
overall public debt at the end of 2013 was 39.4% of GDP – that is significantly less than it sets out Maastricht Limits.
this criterion also meet Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Sweden.
the Czech Republic will also meet this criterion if the Council decides to repeal the excessive deficit procedure as proposed by the Commission.
to two Member States (Croatia and Poland) are currently covered by the excessive deficit procedure and therefore that criterion does not satisfy this criterion.
